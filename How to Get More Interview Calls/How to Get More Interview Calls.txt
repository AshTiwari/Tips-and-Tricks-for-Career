## Main Difficulties in getting calls:
- Too less/more experience
- No Project experience
- Notice Period
- Career Gap


## - Get more interview calls:
- Be vocal on social media like LinkedIn, Twitter write blogs.
- Contribution to OpenSource or good Personal Project are good options if you lack work experience.
- Hide few weakness until the end of interview. 
- If the interview process went good and interviewers are impressed, few weakness can be ignored by HR.
- Upon finding any opening in big companies:
	- Go to LinkedIn and send connect request to as many employees of that company as you can.
	- Use the connection message: "Hi <>, I have noticed you work in <>. I was hoping to connect with you so you can reffer me to this job with jobId <> to increase my chances to get selected."
	- Upon getting referral, apply for the job to increase your chances.


## Tips to deal with hiring Manager:
- avoid unprofessional caller tune
- Be prepared with FAQ (years of exp, skills, notice period, salary expectations)
- Be confident and ask the HR about the topics which will be covered in the interview.
- If the HR is not aware, politely ask them to follow up with the interviewer about this.
- Call back to every call you missed in the interview phase.
- Save contact of every recruiter with their name, company name and any other details to avoid confusion between multiple HR and companies.
- Always follow up with HR after 2 days.
- Avoid cancelling interviews in last minute.


## Imp Resume Tips:
- Mention contact details like Phone Number and Email ID without fail.
- The role in Resume should be same as the role you are applying for (irrespective of your role in your current company).
- Always mention your years of experience. Don't make HR calculate your y.o.e. by looking at Job History.
- Divide Skills in sub-categories.
- For Projects, mention numbers and highlight the technologies used.


## Different Channels
- Job Portals: use less formated resume like a simple word file to pass automatic resume checker
	- Naukri, AngelList, Hirect, Times Jobs, Monster.com;
	- Remote Jobs => Turing
- LinkedIn: Start "job alerts" in LinkedIn
- Referrals: 
- Hackathons: Good for freshers 
- Online Job Affairs: Rare event hence would have less awarness hence less competition


## Data Engineer vs Big Data Engineer:
- D.E. are more familiar with ETL and Data Warehouse.
- B.D.E are more towards working with large data with Hadoop and Spark.
- However there is a major overlap between them and maximum focus is on SQL.


## Successful Personal Experience of Clearing a Job Interview:
=============================================================================
- I saw an opening on glassdoor for Python Developer. 
- I redrafted the resume to match with the Job Description and Required Skills and then applied to it.
- Opened the glassdoor of the company page to checke the interview section and perpared for all the previously asked questions.
- Same can be done on geeksForGeeks but it only have interview experience of big companies like FAANG.
- Upon receiving the email invitation for interview, read the name of the interviewer.
- Searched him on LinkedIn and read about his interest and skills and focused my learning on that.
- Then found his GitHub page and read all his latest work and prepared accordingly.
- Majority of questions were from the topics I had prepared.
- Got the job but rejected it due to personal reasons.
